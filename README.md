# üí´ About Me:
I'm **Kumar Kharare**, a Flutter Developer based in Pune, India, with 3+ years of experience building scalable and visually stunning mobile applications using Flutter. I specialize in cross-platform app development with expertise in **Dart**, **Flutter Widgets**, and **state management (BLoC, Cubit, Provider)**. 

I have successfully delivered production-grade apps across domains like healthcare, temples, and embedded systems. My development approach is clean architecture driven and test-friendly. I actively stay updated with the evolving Flutter ecosystem including **Firebase**, **Supabase**, **Riverpod**, **GoRouter**, and custom UI/UX using **CustomPainter** and **Animations**.

Currently open to challenging roles that demand performance optimization, clean code practices, and Flutter excellence.
